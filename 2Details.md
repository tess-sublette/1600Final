# How to Create and View SVG Files     
     
## Understanding What You'll be Doing      
SVG files can be written by hand with XML code and can create images using shapes and text     
        
----      
## This Simple Demonstration will Make a Blue Circle       
        
## Step 1: Create an SVG File      
- **Text Editor:** Open a text editor such as VSCode       
- **Name It:** Name the file and add the extension .svg at the end       
       
## Step 2: Start Coding       
- Start the code with: "<svg>"       
- Set the size of the SVG by adding in: "width="--" height="--"" to the "<svg>" (Defaulted to pixel measurements initially)       
- Declare the shape on a new line starting with: "<circle"       
- After on the same line declare the cordinates and radius for the circle: "cx="--" cy="--" r="--""       
- Finish off that line with choosing a color for the circle: "fill="blue" />"       
- Final line close the SVG container: "</svg>"       
       
## Step 3: Final Code       
'''html       
'''<svg width="200" height="200">       
  '''<circle cx="100" cy="100" r="80" fill="blue" />       
'''</svg>       

## Step 4: Save Code       
- Make sure to save the file with a .svg extension (ex. circle.svg)       
       
## Step 5: View Your SVG File       
- **Browser:** Drag and drop the file into a web browser       
       
- **GitHub:** Can upload to GitHub       
       
- **Computer:** Can open it with an image viewer that supports SVG (ex. macOS Preview)
